Abstract for 2024-2025 variable star research: We investigated a subset of candidates from NASA’s Disk Detective project in search of new and previously confirmed variable classical Be (CBe) stars. A CBe star is a main sequence star that rotates so rapidly that mass is “flung out” into a decretion disk in which the viscosity of the matter continuously forms the disk. We analyzed the given Be Disk Detective objects with data from NASA’s Transiting Exoplanet Survey Satellite (TESS), uncovering new variability among the Be star candidates and allowing us to categorize the trends of variability seen among the subjects. Based on the TESS analysis, we found candidates whose variability may be confirmed with the Emory observatory during spring 2025. Since TESS’ cameras have a large pixel coverage, our follow-up with Emory’s 24-inch telescope is a critical step in confirming variability. We present a case study of several nights of data on an object of interest: HD 256943. The findings of this study will contribute to the understanding of variability mechanisms in CBe stars.
